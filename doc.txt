0. Introduction

This document is a collection of notes that I gathered while coding
for various classic computers and consoles, typically the ones
displaying bitmap graphics, which happen to be primarily 8-bit and
16-bit, with some possible exceptions (Nintendo Game Boy Advance,
arguably Atari Jaguar).

This document includes multiple types of information, that are not
individually identified as such:
* Facts about the pieces of hardware being described.
* As necessary, the familiar names of chips, instructions, registers,
    and other similar aspects.
* Original writing about that hardware (i.e. everything not included
    in the previous categories.)

1. Atari 2600

The Atari 2600 is a simple 3-chip machine, notable for not having
enough hardware to generate an entire TV frame.

The CPU is a MOS 6507, which is a MOS 6502 core in a smaller package,
which limits it to 8kB of address space and eliminates interrupts.

The primary support chip is a MOS RIOT 6532 "RAM, I/O, Timer", which
is commonly called PIA "Peripheral Interface Adapter" (even though
PIA is the official name of the MOS 6520, a simpler chip). RIOT holds
128 bytes of RAM, I/O ports that map to the console switches and
joystick directions, and a timer that can't be polled (since it can't
trigger interrupts on the interrupt-less 6507).

The A/V chip is called TIA (Television Interface Adapter) and is a
custom chip created by Atari. It handles sound (2 channels with
several sound types and controllable volume but with poor frequency
control) and graphics (enough information to generate a single line
of TV signal, where creating an entire image requires to change the
content of each line in software, in sync with the generation).
It also includes a few additional input ports for controllers.

2. MOS 6502

The 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor, used in a variety of devices,
notably from Apple, Atari, Commodore, Acorn, Oric, Nintendo.

It is designed for simplicity. It has a full 16-bit address bus,
which is not multiplexed with the 8-bit data bus, but the only
internal 16-bit characteristic is the program counter. Notably,
it can't store data addresses in registers, those have to be
held in memory... and must themselves have a 8-bit addresses.
Also, the stack is limited to 256 bytes and has a fixed address.
