0. Introduction

This document is a collection of notes that I gathered while coding
for various classic computers and consoles, typically the ones
displaying bitmap graphics, which happen to be primarily 8-bit and
16-bit, with some possible exceptions (Nintendo Game Boy Advance,
arguably Atari Jaguar).

This document includes multiple types of information, that are not
individually identified as such:
* Facts about the pieces of hardware being described.
* As necessary, the familiar names of chips, instructions, registers,
    and other similar aspects.
* Original writing about that hardware (i.e. everything not included
    in the previous categories.)

1. MOS 6502

2. Atari 2600
